## Report Phishing add-in for Outlook üîç

Training users to report phishing messages correctly is a great way to prevent malicious email  circulating in your company, and helps Microsoft to improve their spam detection success. There is a free add-in that you can deploy from the Microsoft Admin Portal which allows your users to do this.
