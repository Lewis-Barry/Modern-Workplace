## Welcome to a blog dedicated to M365 Business Premium 💽

Everything you see on this blog will contain examples of what is possible with M365 Business Premium combined with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.


### What is Microsoft 365 Business Premium and why should you care? 💓

M365 BP is, in my view, the quintessential starting point for a small business wanting to have best-in-class productivity tools delivered via policy-driven protection and a robust identity management platform.

In a nutshell, it gives your users all the familiar things they expect, and provides dozens of other features which they could be using to improve their workflow. Most deployments of M365 BP that I've seen don't extend beyond Office apps and very basic Intune deployments.

This site will examine each M365 BP feature available to you because, let's face it, understanding Microsoft Licensing entitlements is a challenge in itself. Hopefully you will have a better idea of what is possible for your clients and/or organization after spending some time here.
