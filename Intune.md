## Intune MDM

Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM for your company devices.

> ‚ùî Mobile Device Management / Mobile Application Management

Portal: https://endpoint.microsoft.com

On this site we'll be focussing on a cloud-only approach. This means that all you need to manage your devices is M365 Business Premium and an internet connection.

A shortlist of what Intune can take care of:

- Operating System first-run experience
- Application installations
- Device Patching
- Custom script execution
- Custom configuration policies
- Device Security
- Device Encryption
- Remote wipe, lock and disable

There are several more specific items I could add to that list, but I want to keep it simple for now.

When you combine Intune with Azure AD you can start to picture just how consolidated modern workplace management can be. Many of the old on-prem problems don't exist in this world... the door opens to new ones you'll have to figure out üòé
